## $ cat about-me.txt

I work as a security consultant at a consulting company. My interests in particular include binary exploitation, red teaming and vulnerability research. I play CTFs regularly and like sharing things that I've learnt in the process.

This blog is collection of ctf writeups, offensive techniques, security ramblings and some personal thoughts. I believe that the world can and should be open and free. 

Please contact me by e-mail if you have any questions.
